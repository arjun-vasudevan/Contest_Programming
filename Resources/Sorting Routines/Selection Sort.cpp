/*
 * Selection sort is a rudimentary sorting algorithm that maintains a sorted and unsorted
 * subarray. The process repeatedly takes the minimum element of the unsorted portion and
 * places it at the end of the sorted portion. It is a not a stable algorithm, meaning it
 * does not maintain the relative order of elements with equal values.
 *
 * It has a O(nÂ²) average/best case/worse case time complexity due to the 2 nested loops,
 * which is inefficient on large lists.
